# 🎄✨ Advent of Code Challenge! - 2024 ✨🎄

</div>
Advent of Code is an annual set of coding challenges that begins every year on **December 1st** and runs until **December 25th**. Each day, a new problem is released at midnight (Eastern Time), featuring fun, holiday-themed puzzles that require logic, programming, and problem-solving skills.

This repository is dedicated to documenting and solving the daily challenges of Advent of Code.  

> **Note:** These are **my solutions** and may not be the best or most optimal options. They are my attempts to solve the puzzles and represent my learning journey.

## 🎯 **Goal**
Solve a new programming challenge each day and hone your coding skills while exploring new algorithms and techniques.
